# Option Codes

The `option_codes` field of a vehicle is a comma-delimited set of codes that
represent various options the car was built with. This can include trim options,
battery sizes, color, wheel types, and addon packages.

**As of August 2019, Option Codes cannot be relied on.** Vehicles now
return a generic set of codes related to a Model 3.
