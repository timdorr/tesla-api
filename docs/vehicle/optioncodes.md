# Option Codes

The `option_codes` field of a vehicle is a comma-delimited set of codes that
represent various options the car was built with. This can include trim options,
battery sizes, color, wheel types, and addon packages.

_This list needs a lot of help! If you know of what any of these mean, please
edit this page and submit a_
[_pull request_](https://github.com/timdorr/tesla-api/pulls)_. It is much
appreciated!_
